# 1. the String class method .include? returns true 
# if the string contains sub-string or letter passed to the method
# write a loop which outputs months which do not begin with the letter "J"

# 2. write a game which displays a month and asks for its 
# number position in the year (e.g. April = 4).
#
# Be aware that arrays begin with zero, not one. 
#
# if the user guesses wrong, end the game and display "Game Over.". 
# if the user enter "quit", then display "Bye!" before displaying "Game Over."
#
# remember the built in method $stdin.gets.chomp gets user input and 
# removes (chomps off) the trailing line return.
#
# there are different ways you could write this game. 
# start wondering why one might be better than another.
